#Chapter 3: Evaluation 1

Exercices 
---------

1. Add primitives to perform the various type-testing functions of R5RS: symbol?, string?, number?, etc.
2. Change unpackNum so that it always returns 0 if the value is not a number, even if it's a string or list that could be parsed as a number.
3. Add the symbol-handling functions from R5RS. A symbol is what we've been calling an Atom in our data constructors
